# BTB_Project
 
Welcoeme to my repository! In this project, I try to predict which bourbon is most likely to be at the Buffalo Trace Gift Shop on a given day. I use data from the Buffalo Trace Daily [website](https://buffalotracedaily.com). I use web scraping methods to pull from the historical data tables. When the historical data is not updated, I scrape the daily posts from the website to pull each day's bourbon. I then pre-process the data to make it ready for machine learning models. 

The model is currently running and providing predictions. Over the next few days, I plan to track current model performance. Below, you can find the probability of each bourbon for tomorrow. The figure updates each day at 12pm EST. I'm currently working out potential issues in the daily workflow.
